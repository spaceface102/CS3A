Demonstrating with string matrix:

Matrix set to first array
Congra  y  ar
alm  don  La


Matrix incremented by second array
You're almost done
with the Lab!

Demonstrating with int matrix:
1 2 3
4 5 6


Matrix incremented by second array
7 7 7
7 7 7


Demonstrating with float matrix:

Matrix set to first array
Made two, 2 by 3 matrices and added them together.
The first one is 1 through 6 and second is 0.6 to 0.1
Test operator+ and << and setMatrix with a 1D array
1.6 2.5 3.4
4.3 5.2 6.1


Matrix incremented by second array
Made two, 2 by 3 matrices and added them together.
The first one is all sevens and the second one is all 0.7s
Test operator+ and << and setMatrix with a 1D array and 2D array
7.7 7.7 7.7
7.7 7.7 7.7


Final test, just .setElements and .printMatrix:
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20
21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30
31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40
41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50
51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60
61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70
71 72 73 74 75 76 77 78 79 80
81 82 83 84 85 86 87 88 89 90
91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 99 100

Same output on console with the printMatrix method!
